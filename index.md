Welcome to my website. I am HKU100 Associate Professor of [Data Science](https://datascience.hku.hk/), [Philosophy](https://philosophy.hku.hk/dept/), and [Law](https://www.law.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am also one of the principal investigators at the [AI and Humanity Lab](https://ai-humanity.net/), a research fellow of the [Urban Systems Institute](https://www.usi.hku.hk/), and a faculty affiliate of the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca).

I work primarily in ethics, law, and policy of artificial intelligence and machine learning, including generative AI. I also work in Bayesian statistics and epistemology. My research has appeared in Science, Nature Machine Intelligence, Nature Digitial Medicine, and the Harvard Business Review. It has also been profiled in Forbes, STAT News, China Business News, Tencent QQ, and The Edge Markets (Singapore). I teach BA, MA, MBA, and PhD classes in statistics, philosophy, and decision making.

Before joining the University of Hong Kong, I was tenure track Assistant Professor of Statistics and Philosophy at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) and tenure track Assistant Professor of Decision Sciences at [INSEAD](https://www.insead.edu/) (both in France and Singapore). I completed my postdoc at the [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](http://hss.divisions.caltech.edu/people/boris-babic).

I received a JD, cum laude, from [Harvard Law School](https://hls.harvard.edu/), an MS in [Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) and a PhD in [Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy), from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I practiced law at [Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP](https://www.quinnemanuel.com/) in Los Angeles, a leading business litigation firm, where I represented Samsung, Google, Mattel, and DreamWorks Animation, among other clients. In particular, I spent much of my time working on the now famous (infamous?) ["doll wars"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/22/when-barbie-went-to-war-with-bratz) litigation between Mattel, the makers of Barbie, and rival company MGA, the makers of Bratz.
