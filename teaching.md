At the University of Hong Kong, my tenure stream appointment is in the Department of Philosophy, the Institute of Data Science and (by courtesy) the Faculty of Law. I teach courses across all three departments. In Philosophy, I teach core foundations courses for MA PPE students (PHIL 7101), and MA AIES (PHIL 7001 and PHIL 7010) students. In Data Science, I teach a research oriented PhD course on ethical dimensions of machine learning and artificial intelligence (DATA 8013). And in Law, I teach an LLB course on law and ethics of artificial intelligence (LLAW 3065). 

At the University of Toronto, I taught Bayesian Statistics (STA 365), Statistics Ethics and Law (STA 2052), Ethics of Data Science (PHL 377) and a philosophy of science graduate seminar (PHL 2223). 

At INSEAD, where I am a visiting professor, I occasioanlly teach an MBA class entitled Ethics of Algorithms. Previously, I was a tenure stream professor at INSEAD, and I taught Management Decision Making (MBA), Bayesian Statistics (PhD), and [Quantitative Methods (MBA)](https://borisbabic.com/teaching/inseadqm/home/).  

Here is an introductory lecture I like comparing frequentist to Bayesian approaches to inference: [Bayes Lecture](teaching/teaching_pres_new.pdf).

At the University of Michigan, I designed an introductory class on [statistical methodology and the nature of science](teaching/PHIL155syllabus.pdf). I also TA'd several classes in the Philosophy, Politics, Economics (PPE) program. 
As a postdoc at Caltech, I designed and taught a course entitled [Statistics, Ethics & Law](teaching/sel102_syllabus.pdf). I also taught classes in foundations of probability and philosophy of science.
